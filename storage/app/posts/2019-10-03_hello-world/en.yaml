      Welcome to our travel blog. This where (soon) you are going to find up-to-date info about our journey and about living on board a yacht. We will also publish lots of photos and videos. Keep coming back - soon we will add first articles.

      At the moment s/y Moonshine is already back in the water after over a month offshore. It is the final stage of the repairs but we still have lots of things to do.

      Broken so far:

      * raw water pump cover plate (fixed already)
      * tea/coffee maker (new one is made of metal)
      * tons of spares incorrectly ordered and returned
